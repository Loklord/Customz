    <description>
      <p>While others use magic to do paltry things like conjure fire or fly, the Necromancer is a master over death itself. They study the deep and forbidden secrets that raise the dead, controlling minions toward a variety of goals.  Perhaps they seek the power that mastery over death provides. Perhaps they are serious and unashamed scholars, who reject the small-minded boundaries held to by others. Each enemy they fell becomes an eager and disposable ally, they become immune to the energies of death and decay, and ultimately harness the immortality and power of undeath for themselves.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A NECROMANCER </h4>
      <p>In creating a necromancer, there is one important fact to consider: ‘how did you come into contact with necromancy, and why do you use it?'. Were you a young wizard who discovered their talent for manipulating life essence was more effective than blasting enemies with evocation spells? Did you grow up in a demon-worshipping cult that required the storing of life essence for satanic rituals? Or perhaps the source of your talent is unknown and mysterious? And what is the appeal of Necromancy to your character? Is it simply 'power over others', or did you perhaps lose a loved one to disease and felt the inability to prevent their death frustrating?.</p>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, necromancers are not necessarily evil-doers, nor do all of them seek to subjugate others. In fact, some of them seek to use their powers for good: a poor understanding of their skills as well as their use of frightening undead monstrosities has simply led to a more generalized fear of their capacities. In reality, necromancers are a varied set of people. There is, however, one thing all of them have in common: each necromancer has some form of power over the vital essences that move any living creature - and they seek to use this to their advantage. Whether strayed wizards, aspiring acolytes or even blessed priests of gods of life, necromancers aim to achieve their goals by manipulating the very core of any creature's being.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a necromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at spell casting and plan to take up the Creed of Tomes archetype. Choose Constitution instead if you plan to emphasize either the summoning of undead minions or the manipulation of health pools. Second, choose the Acolyte or Sage background. Third, choose the Chill Touch and Thaumaturgy cantrips.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You draw on the negative energy in the world to fuel your spells.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell false life and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast false life using either slot.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.</p>
      <p>The Spells Known column of the Necromancer table shows when you learn more necromancer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, for your magic draws upon your innate link to the essence of life that sits within all creatures. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
      </p>
      <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
      <p>You can cast a necromancer spell as a ritual if it is a spell you know and that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells.</p>
    </description>
    <sheet display="true">
      <description>You can prepare {{necromancer:spellcasting:prepare}} spells from the your spellbook. You use an arcane focus to cast spells. And can also cast Necromancer spells as a ritual.</description>

      <p>At 20th level, whenever you fall unconscious, you no longer lose your senses, instead experiencing the world around you as a life-like dream. Whenever you would make a death saving throw, you can instead choose to sap energy from your surroundings, causing you to wake up and deal 1d4 necrotic damage to all non-construct, non-undead creatures within 10 feet of you, gaining hit points equal to the damage dealt. If no creatures are within 10 feet of you, you still wake up, but only gain 1 hit point. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
